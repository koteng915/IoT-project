IoT project for Software Engineering course (SKEL413) on Flood Monitoring System

## Problem Statement
Flood is a major known natural disaster that causes a huge amount of loss to the environment and living beings. So in these conditions, it is most crucial to get the emergency alerts of water level status at river beds in different conditions. In this project, the objective is to sense the water levels at river beds and check whether they are at a normal condition or not.
